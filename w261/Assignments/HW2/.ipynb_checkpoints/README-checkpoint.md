### How to submit your work:
#### Step 1.
Submit your work by pushing your completed notebook and supplemental files to your assigned student repository on Git. The file structure should look like this:
```
<repo root>
    --Assignments
        --HW1
           |__hw1_Workbook.ipynb
           |__aggregateCounts.py
           |__pWordCount.sh
           |__wordCount.py
           |__README.md
           |__ <directory for scratchwork>
        --HW2
           |__hw2_Workbook.ipynb
           |__NaiveBayes
           |__EnronEDA
           |__ etc ...
     --HelpfulResources
     etc..
```
#### Step 2.
Please submit the link to your notebook (not just the directory, the actual notebook) using the following form:

### Tips:
* Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!
