The master solutions were ran in a homework cluster (kyle_hw). The runtimes are
listed in python comments in relevant cells.

kyle_hw:   
`i3.xlarge, 30.5 GB memory, 4 cores, 1 DBU; 4 workers, 1 driver`

__UPDATE__: The homework cluster has been changed. The times will be approx. 1/3 faster. The new cluster configuration is:      
`c5.2xlarge, 16.0 GB memory, 8 cores, 1.21 DBU; 4 workers, 1 driver`
