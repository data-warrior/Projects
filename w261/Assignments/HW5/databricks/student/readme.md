## Cluster 6.4 ML
KyleH (small cluster)   
Driver - m4.xlarge, 16.0 GB Memory, 4 Cores, 0.75 DBU   
1 Worker - m4.xlarge, 16.0 GB Memory, 4 Cores, 0.75 DBU   


### PageRank version 1
trained 10 iterations in 8302.966378688812 seconds. (2.3 hours)

### PageRank version 2 
#### (a different implementation which doesn’t care about mass adding to 1 - only rank matters)
trained 10 iterations in 5790.945766210556 seconds. (1.6 hours)

### PageRank Graphframes
(Not sure what's going on with this one. Tried it twice in case of some one off issue, but with same result)
