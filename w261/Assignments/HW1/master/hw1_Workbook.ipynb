We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",

    "### --- SOLUTION ---\n",
    "> The biasâ€“variance tradeoff is a central problem in supervised learning. Ideally, one wants to choose a model that both accurately captures the regularities in its training data, but also generalizes well to unseen data. Unfortunately, it is typically impossible to do both simultaneously. High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well, but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that don't tend to overfit, but may underfit their training data, failing to capture important regularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Models with low bias are usually more complex (e.g. higher-order regression polynomials), enabling them to represent the training set more accurately. In the process, however, they may also represent a large noise component in the training set, making their predictions less accurate - despite their added complexity. In contrast, models with higher bias tend to be relatively simple (low-order or even linear regression polynomials), but may produce lower variance predictions when applied beyond the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the case of regression problems where we estimate mean squared error (MSE), we can decompose the overall expected error in terms of the squared bias, variance, and irreducible error:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[(\\hat{y}-y)^2]=(E[\\hat{y}]-y_{true})^2+E[\\hat{y}-E[\\hat{y}]]^2+E[(y_{true}-y)^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[(y-h(x))^2]  = Bias[h(x)]^2 + Variance[h(x)] + +E[(y_{true}-y)^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Where the h(x) is the model built from each boostrap sample of the test/heldout dataset (see details below).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "> The first term on the RHS is the squared bias, which measures the average error of the model.  The second term is the variance, which measures how much our model's predictions vary from one training set to another.  The final term represent the irreducible error; the variation between our model and reality that we are unable to do anything about (thus the name \"irreducible error\").\n",
    "\n",
    "> Estimating bias and variance for polynomial models on a dataset with unknown underlying functional form will generally be predicated on a bootstrapping procedure, creating an ensemble of models for each polynomial degree. The model variance will be calculated as the average deviation from the average model (for each degree). Measuring bias is unfortunately somewhat less direct, as one cannot separate the irreducible error (noise) present in the data. To determine an estimate of model bias, one can compute the average squared error (across an ensemble) from the testing data and subtract off the model variance, rendering a value that is the sum of irreducible error and squared bias. Ultimately, to choose a model degree one can minimize the overall error, but should also be sure to keep a balance between bias and variance indivdiually, aiming to keep both as low as possible.\n"

    "# Question 3: Tokenizing\n",
    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

    "* __a) short response:__ In the Naive Bayes algorithm (which we'll implement next week), we'll estimate the _likelihood_ of a word by counting the number of times it appears and dividing by the size of the vocabulary (total number of unique words). Using the text: *\"Alice had an adventure that took alice to wonderland\"*, give a concrete example of how two different tokenizers could cause us to get two different results on this calculation. [`HINT`: _you should not need to read up on Naive Bayes to answer this question_]  \n",

Type the answer in the space provided below.\n",

Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",

If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines.

    "> __b)__ Yes, doubling the number of map tasks (approximately) halves the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ When we time our word count algorithm we don't see the perfect scalability that we saw with the demo mapper. Specifically the times are close to equal for 1,2 and 4 partitions but roughly double as we increase to 8 then 16 then 32. One reason the times are similar for 1, 2 and 4 is that while increasing the number of partitions makes the map phase quicker this comes at the expense of an increase in the amount of sorting that has to happen (and consequently the time to sort). The likely reason for the much longer times for 8, 16 and partitions is that I am running on a machine that has only dedicated 4 cores to Docker so I can only parallelize 4 processes simultaneously, when I specify more than 4 mappers some mappers end up waiting for others to finish before they can start. We should not conclude that our algorithm isn't scalable -- it's just not 'ideally' scalable.

    "> \"Embarassingly Parallel\" describes the category of parallel computation tasks that can be implemented in a way that the subtasks rarely or never have to communicate. More specifically we can think of this as the kind of algorithm that can be performed completely in parallel except, possibly, for a single join at the end. Word counting fits this description since we can split the input file into as many subfiles as we like and perform sub counts then join once at the end. More generally any calculation that can be defined in terms of commutative and associative operations on the input records will be embarassingly parallel.    \n",
    "(Async 2.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "> b) The word \"associative\" comes from \"associate\" or \"group\"; the Associative Property is the rule that refers to grouping.In the \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" word count problem, you can group the workload into multiple subtasks in any way you want, summing the results at the ends will give you the same result.\n",
    "The word \"commutative\" comes from \"commute\" or \"move around\".In the same word count problem, you can sum up the counts in any order you like. Hence, \"Embarrassingly parallel\" problems exhibits both associative and commutative properties\n",
