We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",

    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

    "# Question 6: Parallel Word Count (part 1)\n",
    "What would happen if we tried to run our script on a much larger dataset? For one thing, it would take longer to run. However there is a second concern. The Python object that aggregates our counts (`defaultdict`) exists in memory on the machine running this notebook. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. The solution? Divide and Conquer! Instead of running the script on the whole dataset at once, we could split our text up in to smaller 'chunks' and process them independently of each other. __In this question you'll use a bash script to \"parallelize\" your Word Count.__\n",

Then follow the instructions in `pWordCount_v1.sh` to make a one-line modification so that it accepts `aggregateCounts_v1.py` as a 4th argument and uses this script to combine the chunk-ed word counts.

    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simiulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What is the potential scalability problem with the provided implementation of `aggregateCounts_v1.py`? Explain why this supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count wouldn't work on a really large input corpus.  [`HINT:` _see the intro to Q6_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code:__ Fortunately, a 'strategic sort' can solve this problem. Read the instructions at the top of `pWordCount_v2.sh` carefully then make your changes that alphabetically sort the output from the mappers (`countfiles`) before piping them into the reducer script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."
